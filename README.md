# 360-VR-Senior-Project-.v1
My senior year project's first draft.

First time using A-Frame for WebVR project.

This project was intended to be an interactive experience of the university I was attending.

We used my dorm room as a test. Please don't mind the mess ðŸ˜…

A-Frame is a perfect starting point for anyone interested in stepping into the world of VR.


This project was initially created in July 2020.
